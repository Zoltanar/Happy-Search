    <h1>List Results</h1>
    <p>The titles that match the current list and filter are displayed below, you can change the view of the results with the view picker, the rightmost dropdown just above the results.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In Tile View, the default view, you can see some information about each title and also the cover image (if available).</li>
        <li>In Details View you can see most information stored about each vn in a line-by-line view.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Regardless of the view, the user can always click the column headers to sort the results as they prefer.</p>
    <p>The background color for the tile/row is determined by the user&#39;s Userlist or Wishlist status.</p>
    <p>
        Double click a title to bring up the visual novel tab, which displays all information stored about the title, including detailed tag information, description and character traits.<br />
        Additionally, relations to other titles, Anime information and screenshots are also shown.<br />
        If you hold Alt key when double clicking, the VN tab will be created but you will not be sent to it.<br />
    To select multiple visual novels for multi-selection tools, hold Control key while clicking on titles.
    </p>
    <h2>Title's Context Menu</h2>
    <p>Right-click a title to bring up the context menu, which lets you do certain operations to the selected title.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the title's userlist or wishlist status, or vote.<br />
            These operations only work when logged in with password.</li>
        <li>Add the title's producer to your favorite producers.</li>
        <li>List all titles by the title's producer.</li>
        <li>Add notes to title and add title to user-defined groups.<br />
            These operations only work when logged in with password and only with titles in the user's userlist.<br />
            This is because the information is stored in VNDB.org's notes field for titles in userlist.</li>
        <li>Open the title's page on VNDB.org</li>
    </ul>
