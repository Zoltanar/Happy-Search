    <h1>Tag Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to filter the Visual Novel list by tags:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The big box contains the list of tags in the filter.</li>
        <li>You can add tags by using the Tag Search Box described below.</li>
        <li>You can save and manipulate custom tag filters with the buttons on the right.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Buttons and Boxes</h2>
    <h3>Tag Search Box</h3>
    <p>
        You can type the name/alias of a tag here and hit enter or click on a suggestion to add it as a filter.<br />
        If tag entered has exactly the same name (not alias) as an existent tag, or only one tag is found, that tag is added, otherwise, a list of results will be shown.<br />
        You can click a tag in the results list to add it or click anywhere else in the Tag Filtering section to hide the results.<br />
        Example: Entering &#39;protagonist&#39; and pressing enter will add Protagonist to active list of tags, if instead, you wish to search for all tags with &#39;protagonist&#39; in the name/alias, you can click the &#39;S&#39; button to the right.
