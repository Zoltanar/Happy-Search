    <h1>Trait Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to filter the Visual Novel list by traits in the title&#39;s characters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The big box contains the list of traits in the filter.</li>
        <li>You can add traits to the list using the Type Dropdown List and Search Box, described below.</li>
        <li>You can save and manipulate custom trait filters with the buttons on the right.</li>
        <li>Note that the filtering doesn&#39;t require that a single character has all the traits, just that the combination of all the title&#39;s characters has all the traits.<br/>
            (An option may be added to allow for both types of operation in the future)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Buttons and Boxes</h2>
    <h3>Trait Type Dropdown List</h3>
    <p>Use this to select the type of trait to be added to the list of filters.</p>
    <h3>Trait Search Box</h3>
    <p>You can type the name/alias of a trait here and hit enter or click on a suggestion to add it as a filter.<br/>
    If a trait exists with the name entered for the selected trait type, or only one trait is found, it will be added, otherwise, a list of results is shown.<br/>
    You can click a trait in the results list to add it or click anywhere else in the Trait Filtering section to hide the results.<br/>
    Example: Selecting Hair type, typing &#39;green&#39; and pressing enter will add &#39;Hair > Green&#39; to active list of traits, if instead, you wish to search for all traits with &#39;green&#39; in the name/alias, you can click the &#39;S&#39; button to the right.</p>
    <h3>Custom Filter Name Box</h3>
    <p>If you wish to save the list of active trait filters, type a name here and hit Save Filter or press enter.</p>
    <h3>Save Filter</h3>
    <p>Save the list of active filters as a custom trait filter.</p>
    <h3>Delete Filter</h3>
