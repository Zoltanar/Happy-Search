Next Milestone (1.3) == search vn by character traits (eg. get all vns with characters with twin tails)

No Work
---------------
split database into 2, one for general info (vnlist, producerlist) and another for user-specific (userlist, userprodlist)
save general database in the internet and : send general info changes to database in the internet, get database changes from the internet
save settings to %localappdata%
Restart Most common tags - use dedicated thread so it can be restarted instead of overlapped
handle abrupt exit, terminate api connection
allow user to set notes
show vn relations and screenshots/anime etc
add 'exclude tag' filters
refresh favorite producers list when throttling fav pro commands
backup sqlite database!
save relations to database as json array



Incomplete
---------------
make things pretty textured backgrounds
split FormMain into partial class files
Minimize globals by passing parameters - 'added/skipped' ushort instead of int
