    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To get started, you will want&nbsp; to log into VNDB by clicking the &#39;Log In&#39; button, you can log in two different ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entering your User ID which is displayed in your user page in VNDB.org (https://vndb.org/u####)</li>
        <li>Entering your User ID and VNDB.org login credentials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application may be used by different users, identified by their User ID, favorite producers are saved by User ID, however, other settings are saved per application.</p>
    <p>Using login credentials will give you the ability to change Userlist status, Wishlist priority and/or Vote on Visual Novels, it will also allow you to get your userlist/wishlist/votelist if you have them set as hidden.</p>
    <p>If you aren&#39;t using login credentials and attempt to get your User-related titles but no results are found, your lists may be hidden, either login or change the setting and you might have to wait up to 25 hours.</p>
    <h3>User-Related Titles (URT)</h3>
    <p>These are titles in your userlist, wishlist and votelist.</p>
    <h2>Buttons and Settings</h2>
    <h3>Log In</h3>
    <p>Described above, you can check the &#39;Remember&#39; checkbox to save your credentials to be used later (password is encrypted).</p>
    <h3>Update List</h3>
    <p>This will get all your user-related titles from VNDB.org, it will take a while if you have a lot of titles and this is the first time, the update is additive so only new titles are added, therefore consecutive updates should not take long.</p>
    <h3>Show NSFW Images</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, NSFW images will be displayed.</p>
    <h3 id="getnewproducertitles">Auto-update URT</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, user&#39;s URT will be updated every 2 days upon application launch</p>
    <h3>10 Year Limit</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, it will limit VNs fetched from VNDB to those released in the last 10 years, this can reduce throttling. Getting VNs by favorite producer or searching by name will bypass this.</p>
    <h3>Close All VN Windows</h3>
    <p>If you open a lot of VN windows (by clicking the tiles in the list) you can close all of them at once with this button.</p>
