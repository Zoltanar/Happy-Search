    <h1>Favorite Producers</h1>
    <p>This section allows you to add producers to a list in order to quickly filter titles based on the producers, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display titles developed by producers</li>
        <li>Get your <a href="#averagevote">average vote</a> and <a href="#droprate">drop rate</a> on a producer's titles</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="averagevote">Average Vote</h3>
    <p>
        This is the average score based on your votes on a producer's titles.<br />
        Only titles with votes are counted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="droprate">Drop Rate</h3>
    <p>
        This is the percentage of titles which you have dropped, only counting a producer's dropped and finished titles.<br/>
        This can be a useful statistic if you drop titles because they are bad, but choose not to vote because you have not completed the game.<br />
        Drop Rate = (number of dropped titles) / (number of dropped titles + number of finished titles)<br />
        For example, you finished 3 titles and dropped 1, the drop rate is 25% (1/4).
