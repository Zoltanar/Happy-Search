    <h1>Tag Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to filter the Visual Novel list by tags:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Left side contains the ten most common tags for the current list of Visual Novels, you can check the boxes to add that tag to the filters.</li>
        <li>You can also add tags by name by typing in the box at the top, it is case-insensitive and if you wish to use the auto-suggestions you must type in order (Typing &#39;Female&#39; will suggest &#39;Female Protagonist&#39; but not &#39;Strong Female Protagonist&#39;)</li>
        <li>Right side will show current tag filters, you can uncheck the boxes to remove the filters.</li>
        <li>You can save a selection of filters as a custom filter in order to quickly filter by the saved tags instead of having to add them one by one each time.</li>
    </ul>
