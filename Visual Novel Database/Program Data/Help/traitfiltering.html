    <h1>Trait Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to filter the Visual Novel list by traits in the title&#39;s characters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choose the type of trait to be added to the list with the dropdown list and type in the name of the trait in the textbox beside it, is case-insensitive and if you wish to use the auto-suggestions you must type in order.</li>
        <li>Current trait filters will be displayed below the search box, you can uncheck the checkboxes to remove the trait filter.</li>
        <li>You can save a selection of filters as a custom filter in order to quickly filter by the saved traits instead of having to add them one by one each time.</li>
        <li>Note that the filtering doesn&#39;t require that a single character has all the traits, just that the combination of all the title&#39;s characters has all the traits.</li>
    </ul>
