    <h1>Searching and Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to find new titles and filter the current results by means other than those in the Tag Filtering section.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The section to the left of the Help button lets you search for VNs by name or release year.</li>
        <li>Below and to the left is the section where you choose the list of VNs to be displayed.</li>
        <li>To the right is the section where you filter the current list (along with the tag filtering section above).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the explanations below, all titles listed are in local database, not in VNDB, unless stated otherwise.</p>
    <h2>Listing</h2>
<h3>List by Name:</h3>
<p>By pressing enter on the textbox, list all titles with name or original name matching what the user entered (alias to be added later).<br/>
    By clicking the Update button, get all titles with name, original name or alias matching what the user entered, from VNDB.</p>
    <h3>List by Year:</h3>
<p>By pressing enter on the textbox, list all titles released in specified year.<br/>
    By clicking the Update button, get all titles released in specified year, from VNDB.</p>
    <h3>All Titles</h3>
    <p>List all titles.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Producers</h3>
    <p>List all titles by favorite producers.</p>
    <h3>Wishlist Status</h3>
    <p>List all titles with the selected wishlist status.</p>
    <h3>Userlist Status</h3>
    <p>List all titles with the selected userlist status.</p>
    <h3>List by Producer:</h3>
    <p>Lists titles by producer entered by user.</p>
    <h3>List by Group:</h3>
    <p>Lists titles that are in group with the name entered by user.</p>
    <h3>Update</h3>
<p>Gets new titles by producer from VNDB that aren't already in local database.<br/>
    If a producer name is entered that isn't in local database, it will ask user to search VNDB for it.<br/>
    This can be used to list a producer's titles without adding that producer to the user's favorites.
</p>
    <h2>Filtering</h2>
    <h3>Tag/Trait Filter Indicators</h3>
    <p>
        The small squares indicate whether the tag and/or trait filters, respectively, are active.<br />
        Red means they are active and gray means they are not. Click an indicator to clear the respective filter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The button in between indicates whether the filters are used in &#39;AND&#39; mode or &#39;OR&#39; mode.<br />
        &#39;AND&#39; mode will list titles that BOTH have all tags in the active tag filter AND characters with all traits in the active trait filter.<br />
        &#39;OR&#39; mode will list titles that EITHER have all tags in the active tag filter OR characters with all traits in the active trait filter.
