    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <p>To get started, you will want&nbsp; to log into VNDB by clicking the &#39;Log In&#39; button, you can log in two different ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Entering your User ID which is displayed in your user page in VNDB.org (https://vndb.org/u####)</li>
        <li>Entering your User ID and VNDB.org login credentials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application may be used by different users, identified by their User ID, favorite producers are saved by User ID, however, other settings are saved per application.</p>
    <p>Using login credentials will give you the ability to change Userlist status, Wishlist priority and/or Vote on Visual Novels, it will also allow you to get your userlist/wishlist/votelist if you have them set as hidden.</p>
    <p>If you aren&#39;t using login credentials and attempt to get your User-related titles but no results are found, your lists may be hidden, either login or change the setting and you might have to wait up to 25 hours.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Please note that features that connect with vndb.org can be throttled which means that Happy Search must wait some minutes before continuing to connect.<br />
        You can continue using the program's features which don't connect with vndb.org while waiting, such as listing and filtering.<br />
        The status of the connection to vndb.org is displayed in the Status Box, described below.
    </p>
    <h3>Status Box</h3>
    <p>This is the box just above the results list, at the left, it tells you the status of the connection to vndb.org:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ready, this means the connection is ready to be used and you may use the features that connect with vndb.org</li>
        <li>Busy, this means the connection is being used at the moment, you cannot do anything during this time.</li>
        <li>Throttled, this means the connection is not being used but it has received too many commands from Happy Search<br />
            and must wait before continuing, you may use features that don't connect with vndb.org during this time.<br />
            The program will continue executing the method that caused the throttling automatically after enough time has passed.</li>
        <li>Error or Closed, this means connection was closed or failed to open, you can try again by attempting to Log In with the button above.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>User-Related Titles (URT)</h3>
    <p>These are titles in your userlist, wishlist and votelist.</p>
    <h2>Buttons and Settings</h2>
    <h3>Log In</h3>
    <p>Described above, you can check the &#39;Remember&#39; checkbox to save your credentials to be used later (password is encrypted).</p>
    <h3>Update List</h3>
    <p>This will get all your user-related titles from VNDB.org, it will take a while if you have a lot of titles and this is the first time, the update is additive so only new titles are added, therefore consecutive updates should not take long.</p>
    <h3>Other Functions</h3>
    <p>This is a dropdown list of functions that shouldn't be used regularly, for solving errors or changes in past releases.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Get All VN Stats<br />
            Get data about each title's stats, it only needs to be used if you updated from version older than 1.2</li>
        <li>Get All Character Data<br />
            Get data about each title's characters (traits) this can take a while, it only needs to be used if you updated from version older than 1.3</li>
        <li>Get Missing Covers<br />
            Get cover images for titles in the local database, useful if you modify or replace the database externally but do not replace the cover images folder to match.</li>
        <li>Update Title Data (All)<br />
            Updates tags traits and stats of all titles, regardless of their release date or date of last update.<br/>
            Only do this if you don't mind the potentially long time that it could take or if your local database is small.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Update Title Data</h3>
    <p>This will update the tags, traits and stats of all titles that haven't been updated in at least 7 days, it may take a while if there are a lot of titles.</p>
    <p>The number of days between updates is based on the release date of the titles:</p>
    <p>Titles released in last 6 months = 7 days.</p>
    <p>Titles released 6 months - 1 year ago = 14 days.</p>
    <p>Titles released 1 year - 2 years ago = 28 days.</p>
    <p>Titles released 2-10 years ago = 56 days.</p>
    <p>Titles released over 10 years ago aren&#39;t updated.</p>
    <p>Titles released by favorite producers are also updated every 7 days.</p>
    <h3>Show NSFW Images</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, NSFW images will be displayed.</p>
    <h3>Auto-update URT</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, user&#39;s URT will be updated every 2 days upon application launch</p>
    <h3>10 Year Limit</h3>
    <p>Off by default, when turned on, it will limit VNs fetched from VNDB to those released in the last 10 years, this can reduce throttling. Getting VNs by favorite producer or searching by name will bypass this.</p>
    <h3>Close All VN Windows</h3>
    <p>If you open a lot of VN windows (by clicking the tiles in the list) you can close all of them at once with this button.</p>
