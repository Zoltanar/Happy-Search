    <h1>Favorite Producers</h1>
    <p>This section allows you to add producers to a list in order to quickly filter titles based on the producers and provide features such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display titles developed by your favorite producers</li>
        <li>Get your <a href="#averagevote">average vote</a> and <a href="#droprate">drop rate</a> on a producer's titles</li>
        <li>Display upcoming titles by your favorite producers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Take note that in the context of this application, a title&#39;s producer is the <a href="#developer">developer.</a></p>
    <br />
    <h2>Buttons</h2>
    <h3>Add Producers</h3>
    <p>
        This will bring up a window where you can search for producers by name and add the selected ones to your list.<br />
        Remember to <a href="#getnewproducertitles">Get New Producer Titles</a> when you are done with adding producers to the list.
    </p>
    <h3>Suggest Producers</h3>
    <p>Like the above but list will be populated by producers that aren't already favorites, with at least 2 titles finished by the user.</p>
    <h3>Show Title By Selected</h3>
    <p>This will display all titles developed by the selected producers.</p>
    <h3>Remove Selected</h3>
    <p>This will remove the selected producers from your list.</p>
    <h3 id="getnewproducertitles">Get New Producer Titles</h3>
    <p>
        This will get all titles (by favorite producers) from VNDB that are not already in local database.<br />
        Only tries to get them for producers that haven't been updated in at least 2 days.
    </p>
    <h3>Update All Producer Titles</h3>
    <p>This will update data on all titles (by favorite producers) from VNDB including ones already in local database, it usually takes much longer than only getting new titles.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Terms</h2>
    <h3 id="developer">Developer</h3>
    <p>
        A title may have multiple releases, each with a different developer, in order to automatically choose a developer, it is determined to be the developer of the first non-trial release. 
    </p>
    <h3 id="averagevote">Average Vote</h3>
    <p>
        This is the average score based on your votes on a producer's titles.<br />
        Only titles with votes are counted.
    </p>
    <h3 id="droprate">Drop Rate</h3>
    <p>
        This is the percentage of titles which you have dropped, only counting a producer's dropped and finished titles.<br />
        This can be a useful statistic if you drop titles because they are bad, but choose not to vote because you have not completed the game.<br />
        Drop Rate = (number of dropped titles) / (number of dropped titles + number of finished titles)<br />
        For example, you finished 3 titles and dropped 1, the drop rate is 25% (1/4).
