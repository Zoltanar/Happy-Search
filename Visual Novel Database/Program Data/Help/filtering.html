    <h1>Filtering</h1>
    <p>
        This section can be used to filter the results in the main tab.<br />
        Select the type of filter and then the value, then click the Add Filter button to add it to the current custom filter, or Add Permanent Filter to add it to the permanent filter.
    </p>
    <h2>Permanent Filters</h2>
    <p>
        Filters added to this section will persist regardless of Custom Filter selected, an example of how this is useful is to always hide blacklisted titles, or exclude titles in certain languages.<br />
        This is saved to file.
    </p>
    <h2>Custom Filter</h2>
    <p>A custom filter is a selection of filters which can be saved to file, these filters can be quickly changed in this tab and in the main tab.</p>
    <h2>Other Information</h2>
