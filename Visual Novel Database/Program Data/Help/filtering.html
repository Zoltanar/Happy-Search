    <h1>Filtering</h1>
    <p>This section can be used to filter the results in the main tab:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each filter can be toggled on or off and you can save the combination of filters to be used later (These groupings of filters are called Custom Filters).</li>
        <li>Each filter can also be marked as 'Fixed' which means that it will not change when a Custom Filter is selected.<br />
            This is useful if there are filters which you want to be on at all times (such as hide blacklisted items).</li>
        <li>On the filters which have multiple possible options (such as Userlist), you can select a single option by double clicking it,<br/>
            so you don't have to deselect each other option.</li>
        <li>You can also switch between 'Tags AND Traits' mode and 'Tags OR Traits' mode, depending on your preference.</li>
        <li>Information on tags and traits filtering is available in each section respectively.</li>
    </ul>
